The Tracker.ly plugin adds WordPress compatibility to Tracker.ly. Redirect links are routed through WordPress to Tracker.ly for processing and invalid links are sent back to the WordPress 404 page.

The plugin is installed automatically when installing Tracker.ly on a WordPress domain. If you turn on WordPress permalinks after installing Tracker.ly, you can install the plugin from here, or do a repair on the domain through Tracker.ly. Upgrades to the plugin are done through WordPress, separately from Tracker.ly updates to your domain.

After installing, login to WordPress and activate the plugin in WordPress.
